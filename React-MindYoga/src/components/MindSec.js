                Mindfulness. It's a pretty straightforward word. It suggests that the mind is fully attending to what's happening, 
                to what you're doing, to the space you're moving through. That might seem trivial, except for the annoying fact that 
                we so often veer from the matter at hand. Our mind takes flight, we lose touch with our body, and pretty soon we're 
                engrossed in obsessive thoughts about something that just happened or fretting about the future. And that makes us anxious.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Mindfulness is the basic human ability to be fully present, aware of where we are and what we're doing, and not overly 
                reactive or overwhelmed by what's going on around us.
                <br></br>
                Mindfulness is a quality that every human being already possesses, it's not something you have to conjure up, you just 
                have to learn how to access it.</p>
