        <p>Yoga is a mind and body practice with a 5,000-year history in ancient Indian philosophy. 
            There is no written record of the inventor of yoga. Male yoga practitioners are known as yogis, 
            and female yoga practitioners are called yoginis. Both practiced and taught yoga long before any 
            written account of yoga came into existence.
            Over the next five millennia, yogis passed the discipline down to their students, and many different 
            schools of yoga developed as the practice expanded its global reach and popularity.
            The "Yoga Sutra," a 2,000-year-old treatise on yogic philosophy by the Indian sage Patanjali, is a 
            guidebook on how to master the mind, control the emotions, and grow spiritually. The Yoga Sutra is the 
            earliest written record of yoga and one of the oldest texts in existence and provides the framework for 
            all modern yoga.
            Yoga is well known for its postures and poses, but they were not a key part of original yoga traditions 
            in India. Fitness was not a primary goal. Practitioners and followers of yogic tradition focused instead 
            on other practices, such as expanding spiritual energy using breathing methods and mental focus.
            The tradition began to gain popularity in the West at the end of the 19th century. An explosion of interest 
            in postural yoga occurred in the 1920s and 1930s, first in India and later in the West.</p>
